# Low-pass filter applied to motion sensor on android device

Motion sensors consist of three sensors, there are accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. These sensors are vulnerable to noise, so the data from this sensors need to be filtered before the actual use. One of filtering method that can be used is the low-pass filter.
